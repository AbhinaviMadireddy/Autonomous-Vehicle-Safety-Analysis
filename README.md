# Autonomous-Vehicle-Safety-Analysis

This project explores failures and disengagements in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) being tested on public roads in California.\

Autonomous Vehicles are complex systems that use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to integrate mechanical, electronic and computing technologies to make real-time driving decisions. Several states in the USA (e.g. California, Texas,
Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Florida) and other parts of the world (e.g. China [1]) have
already started field-testing AVs on public roads. As AVs have started interacting more
directly with humans on public roads, the safety and resilience of AVs is a significant
concern (Uber’s [2] fatal accident, Tesla’s [3] autopilot flaw) and must be thoroughly
evaluated through analysis of data obtained during field-testing.
